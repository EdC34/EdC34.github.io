                <article>Ed Carroll is an aspiring full stack developer currently studying at We Can Code IT. A longtime computer and video game enthusiast, Ed came to software development after a career in journalism, where he frequently used HTML in content management systems to publish stories and other content. He's experimented with programing on a smaller scale but is excited to graduate from We Can Code IT in December and hopefully begin a career in programing.</article>
